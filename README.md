# Skinstore-Clone

Skinstore is a   multinational retailer of personal care and beauty products. Featuring nearly 340 brands, along with its own private label, Skinstore Collection, skinstore offers beauty products including cosmetics, skincare, body, fragrance, nail color, beauty tools, body lotions and haircare. 

AS part of unit 4 construct week I cloned the frontend of skinstore.com to the best of my ability  within the span of 5 days.
